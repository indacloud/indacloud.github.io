        <p>So I took a moment to write this totally biased autobiography.

            More seriously, I grew up on a farm and a guesthouse. From a young age, I wanted to be an artist, a painter. Maybe a cartoonist or a car designer for Ferrari.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I got my first PC in the early 90s. I broke it the very first day and learned how to reinstall everything. This bulky beige thing challenged me.

            I‚Äôve spent my teenage years playing basketball üèÄ, not that I was good but we had a team of friends. We didn‚Äôt really care about winning or losing, there was no leader, it was about giving the best of ourselves as a unit.

        <h3>
          First experience
        </h3>
        <p>20 years old, I got my first job as a developer for hydraulic test benches. Every software written in C and machine was unique and spread from aeronautics to nuclear power plants. My boss and colleagues were real mentors, both caring and letting you run right into the wall. Did I break expensive sensors because of a stack overflow? Who knows.</p>

        <h3>Suites and travels</h3>
        <p>My next job was to develop and sell CRMs. I traveled a lot across France and Germany. From Monday to Friday, spoiler alert, I burned out.</p>
        <p>This wasn't for me and I decided to try my real passion, the web.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Quit and try</h3>
        <p>I left my job and started as a freelancer. At the beginning, I was developing Wordpress websites and plugins. I even got some missions setting up the HTML for emailings (HTML 1.0).</p>
        <p>Not an easy time but on a Sunday afternoon, I saw a tweet from an early stage startup, Unite Us.</p>
        <p>Let's say it's been a 10 years collaboration. I've got the best mentors from the start and I followed their path. We went through all stages a company can know, pivoting, doubts, growth, layoffs, you name it. But we had a mission, a clear vision, connecting social and health in a way that didn‚Äôt exist.
        </p>
        <p>I had my team of people I call friends. This trust and support gave me the chance to join the headquarters in NYC for 18 months. Back in Europe, my girlfriend had an opportunity to work in Graz - Austria. We spent a little over two years there and felt like it was time for something new. We started a life of digital nomads for about two more years with our van named Leopold and our cat Link. We traveled slowly across Europe from Sweden to Portugal, absorbing cultures, meeting people and the beauty of nature.</p>

        <h3>And now what?</h3>
        <p>I had the time and experience to define my values. I believe the right team with the right vision can change things for the better. This is why I‚Äôm here for (you are too), innovate, make art, create things that never existed before, solve problems we didn‚Äôt know they existed. Build software.</p>

        <h3>10 years Kudoboard extract</h3>
        <p>On my 10 years anniversary at Unite Us, we had a virtual party to celebrate and there is a small extract of the Kudoboard my team made.</p>

          <div class="card bill">
            <p>Tom! Congratulations on a milestone anniversary. I am so glad to have been able to work with you over some of that time -- I always appreciate your expertise and your ability to make work fun and enjoyable. The "fattarrow" misunderstanding is forever engrained in my memory :)
