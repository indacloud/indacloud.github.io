        <p>If you made it here, it means you're looking for a person more than just a profile.</p>
        <p>So I took a moment to write this totally biased autobiography.</p>

            More seriously, I grew up on a farm and a guesthouse. From a young age, I wanted to be an artist, a painter. Maybe a cartoonist or a car designer for Ferrari.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I got my first PC in the early 90s. I broke it the very first day and learned how to reinstall everything. This bulky beige thing challanged me.

          First experience
        </h3>
        <p>20 years old, I got my first job as a developer for hydrolic test benches. Every software written in C and machine was unique and spread from aeronautics to nuclear powerplants. My boss and collegues were real mentors, both caring and letting you run right into the wall. Did I break expensives sensors? who knows.</p>

        <h3>Suits and travel</h3>
        <p>My next job was to develop and sell ERPs. I travled a lot across France and Germany. From Monay to Friday, spoiler alert, I burneed out.</p>
        <p>This wasn't for me and I decided to try my real passion, the web.</p>

        <h3>Quit and try</h3>
        <p>I left my job and stated as a freelance. Not an easy time but one a sunday afternoon, I saSw a tweet from a early stage startup, Unite Us.</p>
        <p>Let's say it's been a 10 years colloboratin. I've got the best mentor from the start and I followed his path. </p>
