        <h3>
          What drives me
        </h3>
        <p>Let's be personal, I'm a regular person. Pleasures are simple, whatever gives you goose bumps, this feeling of being alive, feeling real.</p>
        <p>I crafted coding and my experience to help others.</p>
        <p>I understand machines, to communicate with them, give them instrutions, that's coding, purely digital.</p>
        <p>Then I love arts, how it can transport you into another universe.</p>
        <p>Visual, musical, physical? I love painting, achitecture, putting on an old or new vinyl disk on my analog player or just sitting on a rainy aftrenoon and knitting a scarf.</p>

        <h3>Unite Us</h3>
        <p>It all started with a sunday evening tweet (X.com now) in late 2013.</p>
        <p>A small startup looking for a css ninja :D, I started on moday</p>
        <p>The mission was clear, helping veterans, founded by veterans. This didn't go that way. Couple of years later, the original idea was not only for veterans but can be applied to any individual.</p>
        <p>Here comes the foundings, the hiring. This isn't a startup any more. Talking agile, scrum, sprints. From a monolyth to microservices to back to monolyth, this is the life of a company.</p>
        <p>One thing stood up, trust. In team, managers or above.</p>
        <p>The motto was "be a good human" and it was.</p>

        <h3>Red Cross experience</h3>
        <p>It's basically an office job, you sit and fill in forms smilling.</p>
        <p>But there is the human part, connecting, spending a moment with a stranger to get an idea of the needs, where you could help. Ritht now, there is nothing more I can do, they need food, housing, shcooling for their kids. I'm the early cog, I provide an address so they can move on for further help.</p>
